7,Pakistan passenger plane with 107 on board crashes near Karachi ,"Many people are feared dead after a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane with 107 people on board crashed into a densely populated residential area near the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on Friday, according to officials. Flight PK-303 from Lahore was about to land in Karachi when it crashed at the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir, just a minute before its landing, they said. The PIA Airbus A320 carrying 99 passengers and eight crew members has crashed into the Jinnah housing society located near the airport, a spokesperson of the national airline said. “The captain informed the air traffic tower he is having problems with the landing gear before disappearing from the radar, he said. The flight PK-303 was coming from Lahore to Karachi after the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) allowed limited reception of domestic flights just few days back after weeks of lockdown due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Television channels showed several houses and cars damaged in the society where the aircraft crashed. Rescue and police officials confirmed that at least four bodies have been recovered from damaged houses so far while several injured people were also being taken to hospitals. “It is too early to say how many people have died in this tragic accident but... it will be a miracle if the passengers and crew members have survived this horrible landing,” a senior police official said on condition of anonymity. This is the first major aircraft crash in Pakistan after December 7, 2016, when a PIA ATR-42 aircraft from Chitral to Islamabad crashed midway. The crash had claimed the lives of all 48 passengers and crew, including singer-cum-evangelist Junaid Jamshed.  “All  my prayers are with the families. We will continue to provide information in a transparent manner,” PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper. Footage showed plumes of smoke rising from the site of the crash. Ambulances and rescue officials arrived at the scene to help residents.  A statement by the Pakistan Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that Army Quick Reaction Force and Sindh Pakistan Rangers reached the spot for carrying out rescue and relief operations alongside civil administration.

9,H-1B legislations introduced in Congress to give priority to U.S.-educated foreign youths,"A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a legislation in both the chambers of the U.S. Congress proposing major reforms in skilled non-immigrant visa programmes by giving priority to U.S.-educated foreign technology professionals in issuing H-1B work visas. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, as introduced in House of Representatives and Senate, will require U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to prioritise for the first time the annual allocation of H-1B visas. The new system would ensure that the best and brightest students being educated in the United States receive preference for an H-1B visa, including advanced degree holders, those being paid a high wage, and those with valuable skills, proponents of this major legislative reforms said Friday. In the Senate, it was introduced by Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin. In the House of Representatives, it was introduced by Congressmen Bill Pascrell, Paul Gosar, Ro Khanna, Frank Pallone and Lance Gooden. The legislation reinstates Congress’s original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programmes by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders, the lawmakers said. The legislation, among other things, explicitly prohibits the replacement of American workers by H-1B or L-1 visa holders, clarifying that working conditions of similarly employed American workers may not be adversely affected by the hiring of an H-1B worker, including H-1B workers who have been placed by another employer at the American worker’s worksite. These provisions address the types of abuses that have been well-documented. Importantly, the legislation proposes increased crackdown on outsourcing companies that import large numbers of H-1B and L-1 workers for temporary training purposes only to send the workers back to their home countries to do the same job. Specifically, the bill would prohibit companies with more than 50 employees, of which at least half are H-1B or L-1 holders, from hiring additional H-1B employees. The bill gives the U.S. Department of Labor enhanced authority to review, investigate, and audit employer compliance with programme requirements, as well as to penalise fraudulent or abusive conduct. It requires the production of extensive statistical data about the H-1B and L-1 programs, including wage data, worker education levels, place of employment, and gender. In addition, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act encompasses several reforms of the L-1 visa programme, including establishment of a wage floor for L-1 workers; authority for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to investigate, audit, and enforce compliance with L-1 program requirements; assurance that intra-company transfers occur between legitimate branches of a company and don’t involve shell facilities; and a change to the definition of specialised knowledge to ensure that L-1 visas are reserved only for truly key personnel. Asserting that Congress created these programmes to complement America’s high-skilled workforce, not replace it, Mr. Grassley said that unfortunately, some companies are trying to exploit the programmes by cutting American workers for cheaper labour.",REAL

53,Bill Gates Paralyzed half a million children with polio vaccines.,"It is difficult to understand how a man whose vaccines intiatives have injured and killed untold thoudands of innocent children all around the world is now being given a paltform to push for mandatory Wuhan coronavirus as condition for ending the lockdowns.  Bill Gates, in case you had not yet figured out the character in question, is pushing not just for mandatory vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), but also for “digital certificates” that prove vaccination status. This is the only way people will be allowed to return to work, assuming Gates gets his way. But have people forgotten that Gates has spent billions of dollars over the years vaccinating children for other things, all the while inflicting them with permanent injury and even death? A single vaccine campaign that Gates launched in India for polio ended up causing non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP), or permanent paralyzation, in nearly half a million children between the years of 2000 and 2017. After the Indian government demanded that Gates and his cronies leave India following this epidemic of permanent injury, rates of NPAFP dropped precipitously. But this has not stopped Gates from inflicting similar damage elsewhere, with injury and death tolls that more than likely are in the tens of millions, at this point. An outspoken eugenicist and “elite” supremacist, Gates lives to vaccinate. After conveniently ditching the board of Microsoft right as the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic started to come into full swing, Gates has been doing nothing other than advocating for mass vaccination and indefinite lockdowns until everyone on the planet is jabbed",FAKE
